##### I'm a brazilian programmer 💻 who likes board games, listen to music, watch movies and eat 🍝. 
##### I'm currently working as a software developer intern at Mobicare, a brazilian company that creates telecom solutions to internet providers. 📶
##### I'm an undergraduate student at UNIRIO (Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro) pursuing my bachelor's degree in Information Systems.
##### My favorite programming language is Java ❤️
##### I have experience working with Java, Python, SQL and Javascript. Also, I feel comfortable working with Linux environments. 
##### I'm very interested in Deep Learning and I was part of a research group at UNIRIO for 6 months. We worked with *Generative Adversarial Networks* (GANs) and the concept of beauty. I intend to write my final paper on this topic.
##### Fun fact: I have a goal to be fluent in french. *J'adore voir la série Dix Pour Cent sur Netflix 🍿*
